## PR

- [Pydrofoil difftest workload](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/4926)
  Basic functionalities (e.g. difftest_regcpy, difftest_csrcpy, difftest_skip_one) are available yet need further test to ensure correctness.
- [Documenting Pydrofoil Building with Nix](https://github.com/pydrofoil/pydrofoil/pull/140), and [Out-of-tree Nix support](https://github.com/definfo/pydrofoil/tree/nix-support)

## Issues
- [Fix Pydrofoil build on rpypkgs](https://github.com/rpypkgs/rpypkgs/issues/1)
  Current Makefile-based build procedure is fragile with unstable deps, such as sail-riscv, isla.
  [rpypkgs](https://github.com/rpypkgs/rpypkgs) maintains RPython/PyPy projects (including pydrofoil-riscv), and is working on Pydrofoil scripting API support.
  Note that Pydrofoil scripting API isn't supported.
