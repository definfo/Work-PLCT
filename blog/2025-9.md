## Issues
- [Discussion about refactoring Pydrofoil build targets](https://github.com/pydrofoil/pydrofoil/issues/142)

  The SAIL team has confirmed that they are planning to integrate Pydrofoil into sail-riscv CI.

## Commits

- [(WIP) Fix/Refactor build for pypy-c-pydrofoil-riscv](https://github.com/rpypkgs/rpypkgs/commit/15c008aa553c140cef28af1f553bb455718e4b74)
  This commit tries to extend PyPy bootstrapp procedure, giving way to injection of external PyPy module(s) during compilation.
  Extension for multiple sources, conflict-resolution for PYTHONPATH are not implemented yet.

- [Fix workload linking with PyPy3 interpreter](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/xs-env/commit/3ac81d778534a558db88f1876d6c2fd2bbb799cd)
  Pydrofoil can now *work*, at minimal level, with XiangShan co-simulation, yet halts at PyPy initialisation.
  After [packaging PyPy3 interpreter with pydrofoil-riscv module](https://github.com/rpypkgs/rpypkgs/commit/15c008aa553c140cef28af1f553bb455718e4b74), XiangShan should work without build issues.
